Overview:
Chinook is a fictional digital media store database designed for learning and demos. It models real-world entities—artists, albums, tracks, customers, invoices, employees, playlists, and more—using data inspired by an iTunes library and synthetic sales information. The schema includes 11 relational tables with realistic constraints, indexes, and over 15,000 rows of data.
